          <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online.

In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>

          <h2>Do we use 'cookies'?</h2>
          <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>
          
          <h3>We use cookies to:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Help remember and process the items in the shopping cart.</li>
            <li>Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.</li>
            <li>Keep track of advertisements.</li>
            <li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Third-party disclosure</h2>
          <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.</p>

          <h2>Third-party links</h2>
          <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

          <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
          <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p>

          <h3>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
            <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
            <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h2>
          <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

          <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
          <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
          <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

          <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>
          <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

          <h3>We collect your email address in order to:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
            <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
            <li>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
            <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
            <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
            <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
            <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
            <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
          </ul>
